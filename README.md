# Spring Security Sample

This is a simple project that configures spring-security.

This was based on this tutorial: http://kielczewski.eu/2014/12/spring-boot-security-application/

This is using:
- Spring Boot 1.2.5
- Spring Security
- MySQL
- Freemarker
- Java 1.7

To run:
- Create a sample application.properties from application.properties.sample
- Create a database, and run the script in src/main/resource/sql
- Run: ```mvn spring-boot:run```
- Go to ```localhost:8080```
